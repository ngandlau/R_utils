# R_utils
A library of R utility functions that I find useful for my daily work as a PhD student working on...

* customer cohort analysis
* age-period-cohort analysis
* customer-based firm valuations
* ...

Includes utility functions that are useful for when one needs to work with both Excel and R interchangably.
